/*
有一个试卷作答记录表exam_record，请从中统计出总作答次数total_pv、试卷已完成作答数complete_pv、已完成的试卷数complete_exam_cnt。
示例数据（uid用户ID, exam_id试卷ID, start_time开始作答时间, submit_time交卷时间, score得分）

#Method-1
SELECT COUNT(exam_id) AS total_pv, 
       COUNT(submit_time) AS complete_pv, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT
       CASE
           WHEN submit_time IS NOT NULL THEN exam_id
       END) AS complete_exam_cnt
FROM exam_record;

#Key Point:
#1. CASE...WHEN Clause
SELECT column_name
       CASE
           WHEN condition_1 THEN result_1
           WHEN condition_2 THEN result_2
           ELAS
       END AS
FROM table_name;

#Method-2
SELECT COUNT(exam_id) AS total_pv, 
       COUNT(submit_time) AS complete_pv, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT
       IF(submit_time IS NOT NULL, exam_id, NULL)) AS complete_exam_cnt
FROM exam_record;

#Key Point:
#2. Count with If Condition
SELECT [DISTINCT] COUNT([DISTINCT] 
           IF(<condition>, <expression>, NULL)) 
           AS alias_name 
FROM table_name;
#3. IF Function: IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)
